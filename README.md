# Project 9 - Build a 'New Releases' music site using React 
In this week's project at Technigo Bootcamp 2019 we built React components to make a page which shows new releases of albums and singles.

I got a chunk of json from a Spotify-API which included data for 50 recent releases. Using `.map()` I iterated over the albums and artists. The styling is supposed to follow Spotify's own design.
